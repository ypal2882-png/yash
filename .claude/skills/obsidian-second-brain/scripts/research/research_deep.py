"""/research-deep [topic] [--free] [--academic] - vault-first deep research.

Paid flow (default when PERPLEXITY_API_KEY is set):
1. Vault scan: find existing notes on this topic (baseline knowledge).
2. Identify gaps via Perplexity.
3. Targeted research: Perplexity (web) + Grok (X discourse) to fill gaps.
4. Synthesize the delta vs baseline (Perplexity), write the note, emit a
   propagation payload for the calling Claude to run /obsidian-save.

Free flow (no key, or --free): vault scan + free key-less source aggregation,
then emit JSON. The calling Claude does the gap analysis + delta synthesis
itself, writes the AI-first note to Research/Deep/, and propagates via
/obsidian-save (see commands/research-deep.md). The vault scan is identical in
both modes - /research-deep is vault-first by definition, so OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH
is required either way.

## What Looks Current and Reliable
- [Specific claim from the vault that still seems trustworthy, with the source note]

## Targeted Research Queries
List 3-5 SPECIFIC search queries that would fill the gaps above. Format each on its own line as: `query | source`
where source is one of `web` (for Perplexity) or `x` (for Grok+X). Examples:
- "Anthropic Claude memory tool 2026 features" | web

TOPIC: "{topic}"
TODAY: {today}

VAULT BASELINE (what the vault already knew):
{baseline_summary}

NEW EXTERNAL FINDINGS:
{findings}

CRITICAL FORMAT RULES - DO NOT DEVIATE:
- Output ONLY the six sections below, in this exact order, with these exact headers.
- Use markdown bullets (- ...) inside each section. NO long narrative paragraphs.
- Do NOT add an introduction, preamble, conclusion, or "report" framing.
- Do NOT exceed ~1200 words total.
- Every external claim has a recency marker (date) AND source domain.
- Vault paths: ONLY write a [[path]] wikilink if that exact path appears in the VAULT BASELINE above. NEVER invent or guess a vault path. If you mean a note that is not in the baseline, refer to it by a plain quoted title and mark it "(new note)" - e.g. Create a new note "AI memory tools" (new note). A wrong [[path]] causes a fabricated file, so when unsure use a title, not a link.
- Be ruthless about contradictions - flagging them is the most valuable output.

## What's New Since Vault Baseline
- [Specific new fact from external sources, with recency marker and source domain]
- [...]

## What's Confirmed
- [Specific vault claim that external sources still agree with]
- [...]

## Contradictions / Updates Needed
- [Specific claim where new external info contradicts a vault note - name the [[exact baseline path]] (only if it is in the baseline) and the specific contradiction]
- [...]

## Synthesis
- [3-6 short bullets, NOT paragraphs. Each bullet captures one synthesized insight that combines baseline + new findings, with [[wikilink to a baseline path]] or URL citations inline]

## Recommended Vault Updates
- [Specific instruction. Use [[path]] ONLY for a path in the baseline, e.g. "Update [[wiki/concepts/AI memory.md]] with the Anthropic memory tool launch (2026-02)". For anything not in the baseline, write: Create a new note "Title" (new note) - do NOT invent a path.]
- [Each instruction either references a real baseline path or describes a new note by title]

## Open Questions
- [What's still unclear after this round of research]
- [...]
