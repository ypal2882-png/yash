# adapters/hermes/adapter.sh - Nous Research Hermes Agent platform adapter
# =============================================================================
# Hermes Agent ships a native Skills System (agentskills.io-compatible): a skill
# is a directory `skills/<category>/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter
# + body). Hermes loads skills with progressive disclosure, the user installs a
# set by adding the repo as a "tap" (`hermes skills tap add <owner/repo>`) or
# copying into `~/.hermes/skills/`, and invokes them via `/skills` or implicit
# description match.
#
# We emit one native Hermes skill per command, grouped by category. This is the
# Hermes-runtime counterpart to the Codex native-skills adapter (Phase 2 of the
# Hermes work, Issue #79). The MCP connector (integrations/obsidian-mcp-server)
# is the separate bounded-data path; this adapter is the skill/playbook path.
#
# SKILL.md frontmatter (per Hermes creating-skills spec):
#   required: name, description, version, author, license
#   optional: metadata.hermes.tags (+ more we do not need here)

# Box 4 - the lifecycle-hook story, told honestly. Hermes's session-lifecycle

# Hermes: scheduled maintenance and the PostCompact analog

The Claude Code build maintains the vault two ways: opt-in scheduled agents
(`/schedule`) and an opt-in PostCompact hook (`hooks/obsidian-bg-agent.sh`) that
propagates conversation context into the vault after the context is compacted.
This documents the Hermes equivalents.

## Scheduled maintenance (cron) - shipped

The four scheduled agents are emitted as native Hermes blueprint skills under
`optional-skills/`:

| Skill | Schedule | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `obsidian-morning` | `0 8 * * *` | Create today's daily note, surface due/overdue + stale projects |
| `obsidian-nightly` | `0 22 * * *` | Sleeptime consolidation: close day, reconcile, synthesize, heal, log |
| `obsidian-weekly` | `0 18 * * 5` | Generate the weekly review note |
| `obsidian-health-check` | `0 21 * * 0` | Vault health report (report only) |

They live in `optional-skills/` (not `skills/`) on purpose: a Hermes blueprint
arms as soon as its skill is loaded, and these are opt-in by design. Arm one
with `hermes skills install <name>`; it then runs unattended on its schedule.
None of them delete or archive - they only add, update, link.

## PostCompact analog (lifecycle hook) - shipped

The Claude PostCompact hook fires on context compaction to propagate the session
into the vault. Hermes's analog is the `on_session_end` event hook (declared in
`cli-config.yaml`). This build ships it:

- **`hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh`** - an `on_session_end` hook that, on
  a completed (non-interrupted) session, runs the `obsidian-nightly`
  consolidation pass and prints `{}` (the observer-hook contract). It mirrors the
  Claude bg-agent's trust model exactly: OPT-IN, ships INERT, no-ops unless BOTH
  `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` and `OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1` are set; add/update
  /link only, never delete or archive.
- **`hooks/hermes-hooks.cli-config.example.yaml`** - the paste-in
  `cli-config.yaml` block registering the hook.

Install:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/agent-hooks
cp hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh ~/.hermes/agent-hooks/
chmod +x ~/.hermes/agent-hooks/obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh
# merge hooks/hermes-hooks.cli-config.example.yaml into your cli-config.yaml,
# then: export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=... OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1
```

**The one unverified seam:** how to invoke Hermes headlessly for the
consolidation run. The script defaults to `hermes run --quiet` and lets you
override it with `OBSIDIAN_HERMES_CONSOLIDATE_CMD` if your Hermes version uses a
different non-interactive entrypoint. The hook wiring, payload parsing, trust
gate, and stdout contract are all built to the documented `on_session_end` spec;
confirming the headless invocation on a live Hermes is the remaining check
(Issue #79). The `obsidian-nightly` cron blueprint covers the same maintenance
on a daily cadence regardless.

# Install on Hermes Agent

The obsidian-second-brain commands are emitted here as native Hermes skills
under `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` (agentskills.io-compatible).

## Option A - install from this built tree

```bash
# From the repo root, after `bash scripts/build.sh --platform hermes`:
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain
cp -R dist/hermes/skills/. ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/
# Shared specs + Python helpers the skills reference:
cp -R dist/hermes/references ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/references
cp -R dist/hermes/scripts    ~/.hermes/skills/obsidian-second-brain/scripts
```

## Option B - add as a tap (when published to a skills repo)

```bash
hermes skills tap add <owner>/<repo>
```

Then in Hermes:

- Browse with `hermes skills browse` / the `/skills` command, or just describe
  the task and let Hermes select a skill from its description.
- Skills run in your Hermes session. The AI-first vault rule lives in
  `references/ai-first-rules.md` - it is non-negotiable for every note a skill
  writes (`## For future Claude` preamble, rich frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]`,
  recency markers, sources verbatim, confidence levels).
- Python helpers under `scripts/` run via `uv run -m scripts.research.<name>`
  from the vault root.

## Scheduled agents (opt-in)

The four scheduled maintenance agents are emitted as native Hermes blueprint
skills under `optional-skills/` (morning / nightly / weekly / health-check).
They are NOT auto-armed - install one explicitly to arm its schedule:

```bash
cp -R dist/hermes/optional-skills/. ~/.hermes/optional-skills/
hermes skills install obsidian-nightly   # arms the 10pm consolidation pass
```

See `HOOKS.md` for the full schedule table and the PostCompact-analog story.

Point Hermes at your vault as the working directory, or pair these skills with
the MCP connector (`integrations/obsidian-mcp-server/`) for bounded vault data
access. Remaining lifecycle-hook wiring is tracked in Issue #79.
