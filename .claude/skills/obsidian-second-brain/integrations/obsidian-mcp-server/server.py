"""Obsidian Second Brain MCP server.

Exposes the vault as a set of MCP tools so any MCP client - Hermes Agent (via
`discover_mcp_tools()`), Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor - can search, read,
and add notes to an Obsidian vault. This is the "second brain as a tool" connector
(GitHub Issue #60): it does NOT touch the agent's own memory; it gives the agent a
doorway into the knowledge vault.

Run:
    OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/vault uv run --with mcp python server.py

or wire it into a client's MCP config (see README.md).
