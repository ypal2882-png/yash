# obsidian-hermes-session-end.sh - Hermes on_session_end vault-maintenance hook
#
# The Hermes-runtime analog of the Claude PostCompact hook (obsidian-bg-agent.sh).
# Hermes fires `on_session_end` hooks declared in cli-config.yaml, piping a JSON
# payload to stdin and reading JSON back from stdout. This hook runs the vault
# consolidation pass (the obsidian-nightly procedure) at the end of a completed
# session, so the vault stays current without waiting for the nightly cron.
#
# TRUST CAVEAT: like the Claude bg-agent, this writes to the vault UNATTENDED, so
# it is OPT-IN and ships INERT. It does nothing unless BOTH are set:
#   - OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH                 (where to write), AND
#   - OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1      (a second, deliberate enable flag)
# It also no-ops on interrupted sessions, and never deletes/archives - add/update
# /link only.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Register this script as an on_session_end hook in cli-config.yaml
#      (see hooks/hermes-hooks.cli-config.example.yaml).
#   2. Export OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH and OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED=1.
#   3. chmod +x this script.
# To disable: clear OBSIDIAN_HERMES_HOOK_ENABLED (the gate below makes that enough).
#
# The one runtime-specific seam: how to invoke Hermes headlessly to run the
# consolidation. It is configurable via OBSIDIAN_HERMES_CONSOLIDATE_CMD; the
# default below is the documented best guess and may need adjusting to your
# Hermes version (Issue #79 tracks confirming it on a live runtime).
#
# Contract: always print `{}` to stdout (silent no-op for an observer hook).
# Logs: /tmp/obsidian-hermes-session-end.log
